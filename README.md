# Cuda

CUDA has been deeply fascinating me lately. 
The fact that you can spin up millions of threads and drastically reduce execution times by massively parallelising sounds beautiful to me!

This will be my attempt at computing things on an NVIDIA GPU. It doesn't matter if the Kernels are already built, the goal is to learn and not just use
an abstract implementation.

Since I do not own an NVIDIA GPU, I'll be exploring all of this on Colab with torch extensions.
Wish me luck =))
